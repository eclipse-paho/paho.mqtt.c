 *  - MQTT5-3.1.2-21                 server overriding the requested keepalive
 *  - MQTT5-3.1.3-6 / MQTT5-3.1.3-7  zero-length client id assigned by server
 *  - MQTT5-3.1.4-3                  second client with the same id disconnects the first
 *  - MQTT-3.3.1-11                  zero-byte retained publish deletes a retained message
 *  - MQTT-3.10.4-5                  unsubscribe from a non-subscribed topic still gets an unsuback
 *  - MQTT-2.1.2-6 / MQTT-2.1.2-10   retained flag on store, cleared flag on live delivery
